# Triangle Inequality Theorem Proof with React App

![Triangle Inequality Theorem](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/triangle-abc-1621326328.png)

This repository contains a React web application that visually demonstrates the **Triangle Inequality Theorem** and provides an interactive proof for this fundamental geometric principle. The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

## Introduction
The Triangle Inequality Theorem is a crucial concept in geometry that is often used to determine whether a given set of side lengths can form a valid triangle. It helps us understand the relationship between the sides of a triangle and forms the basis for many geometric proofs.

This React app provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore the Triangle Inequality Theorem. Users can input the lengths of three sides of a triangle, and the app will visually demonstrate whether the triangle is valid or not according to the theorem. Additionally, the app will display the mathematical proof of why the triangle is valid or invalid.

## Demo

## Website
The project can be viewed as (https://vashz151.github.io/CDAC-OLABS/).

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Triangle Inequality Theorem React app locally on your machine:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vashz151/CDAC-OLABS
```

2. Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
Once you have installed all the dependencies, you can run the React app locally using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Now, you can interact with the app by entering the lengths of three sides of a triangle. The app will provide a graphical representation of the triangle and display whether the sides form a valid triangle based on the Triangle Inequality Theorem. If the triangle is valid, the app will also display the mathematical proof.

Feel free to explore different combinations of side lengths and observe how the theorem holds true for valid triangles.
